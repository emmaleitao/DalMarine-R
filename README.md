## DalMarine-R
(This is just a prototype repository.) 

Welcome to the DAMS Introduction to R repository! The goal of these seminars is to help fellow students in science learn how to use sceintific programming to further their education and improve their skills. The seminars are designed for everyone to follow along on their own computers and practice coding. Lectures will be recorded and posted online so anyone can go back and refer to what we discussed. As well, all files used during the seminars will be made availble here.
